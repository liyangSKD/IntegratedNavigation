integrated navigation using INS/GNSS

due to I know little about computer copyright issue, this repository is not publicly available.

# INS/GNSS integrated navigation uses Openblas(http://www.openblas.net/), I really appreciate.

Body coordinate: front-right-down
navigation coordinate: north-east-down

ins.h/ins.cc have implemented Allan Variance and coarse alignment. Allan Variance is not used in integrated navigation.
